# SMD-Website-Bid-Calculator
This project built using python addresses the Bidding amount issue on the [(url)https://www.smd.co.za/] website. 

## **ISSUE:**

The bid that is placed on the website for the online auctions is actually the amount you are bidding **WITHOUT** the hidden fees and taxes
you are liable on the amount you bidding 

 ## **For Example :**

Placing a bid of R50 000 at online auction

Actual liability :

-5% buyers premium
-R2 500 document handling fee
-15% VAT on total of above bid , buyers premium and document handling fee

Therefore the total bid placed of R50 000 is actually R63 250 after all the fees are included

## **Solution**

This project aims to make the hidden cost visible to all persons placing a bid at the online auctions
